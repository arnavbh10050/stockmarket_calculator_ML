This code employs a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model to predict stock prices by analyzing the correlation between the daily closing price and the high price. To train the model for a particular stock, you need historical data spanning from 2008 to 2021. Using this data, the model can forecast stock prices from 2021 to the present.
I tried Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft to test the code. The RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) ranged from 6 to 14 which is pretty good for a basic algorithm like this.
